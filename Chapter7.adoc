== Hubs and Premises

For inside building applications, there are two basic types of mounting commonly used. Hub sites such as central oﬃces and head-ends will typically use racks to mount single-mode splice, patch, and distribution panels, along with transmission equipment. They may also use wall-mounted storage and splice panels to increase ﬂexibility and simplify internal cable routing.

Premises and data centers tend to use racks in hub sites and wall-mounted panels in remote locations. Generally, multimode ﬁber is used, but single-mode ﬁber is seeing more deployment as data rates increase. For premises installations, the structured wiring terminology in TIA-568, TIA-569, and IEC 11801 is used.

== Fiber Management - Traditional Installation

Loose tube cable is spliced at the outside cable vault and routed into the building. If the distance inside the building exceeds 50’, the cable must be placed inside electrical metallic tubing (EMT) per NEC Article 770. The cable is routed to the correct rack and then to the splice panel. If there are metallic members in the cable they must be grounded per NEC Article 250. The internal ﬁbers are then routed to the splice tray via buﬀer tubes or transition tubing making sure the internal ﬁbers are protected. Pigtails are spliced to these ﬁbers via the splice trays. The pigtails are then properly installed and routed making sure no macro or microbends are present.

.Without OFNR cable.

* Loose tube cable is spliced at the outside cable vault and routed into the building. 
* Cable is routed to the correct rack and then to the splice panel, where internal ﬁbers are routed to the splice tray via buﬀer tubes or transition tubing. 
* Pigtails are spliced to these ﬁbers via the splice trays and connected to the patch panel. 
* Patchcords and jumpers are used to link transmission equipment.

== Fiber Management - Preterminated Patch Panels

Loose tube outside plant cable is routed to a wall mount ﬁber entrance cabinet (FEC). The patch panel has been ordered with the correct connector type (e.g., SC) and polish (UPC or APC) and a predetermined length of NEC-rated cable (OFNR or OFNP). The panel is mounted in the rack and the cable stub is routed to the FEC via ﬁber optic cable trays where it is spliced to the incoming outside plant cable. This technique saves rack space, has a lower installed cost, and centralizes all splices in one convenient location.

image::media/predeterminedPatchPanel.png[400,400,align="center"]

== Rack Space

As bandwidth consumption has increased, the demand for additional ﬁbers continues to grow. However, the amount of physical space available to house those ﬁbers is often a problem. Proper management of rack space is important to meet these growing demands for density.

Racks are listed in terms of rack units (RUs), which is measured in height. For example, a 1RU panel is 1.75 inches, and a 2RU panel would be 3.5 inches. A full size rack is 6 feet (1.8 meters) and can accommodate 42 RUs. This can be either 19 inches for data communications cabinets, or 23 inches for standard telephony installations.

.Connector Density Comparison.

Connectors also play a major part in density. The SC, LC, and MPO push/pull connectors have all been designed for ease of coupling by the user. However, density is the major reason why high-density connectors are needed where transmission equipment and ﬁber management products are installed. While the SC connector is better for those with large hands, the LC has double the density of a standard SC connector.

== Patch Panels - Intermediate and Main Cross-connects

IC and MC patch panels provide a central location for patching, testing, monitoring, and restoring service to ﬁber-optic transmission lines. The patch panel receives the ﬁber optic patchcords or jumpers from the splice panel or from equipment and properly routes it to other pieces of equipment.

Patch panels can be main cross-connects or intermediate cross-connects. Personnel can access backbone cabling in intrabuilding links and transmission equipment. Patch panels are available with various types of connector options. Preterminated patch panels routed to optical entrance enclosures allow for easy installation.

.diagram shows Patch Panels.
image::media/patchPanelIntermediareCrossConnect.png[align="center"]

* Centralized location for patching, testing, monitoring and restoration.
* For LANs the patch panel may be the main cross-connect (MC) or an intermediate cross-connect (IC)
point.

== Splice Panels

Splice panels allow the user several options to route ﬁber optic cable and are most commonly used in two locations:

1. As a transition point between outside plant loose tube single-mode cables with 250-µm coated ﬁbers and pigtails with 900-µm coated ﬁbers. These panels are most often mounted in 19” racks either above or below the patch panel or integrated within a patch and splice panel.

2. As an optical entrance enclosure, normally wall-mounted at an entrance facility where the required National Electric Code transition point is made.

In order to meet the NEC’s requirements for a transition from outdoor cable to indoor tight tube cable, the outdoor cable must be terminated or spliced within 50 feet (15 meters) of the building entrance unless enclosed in grounded rigid metal conduit (NEC 800-40(b)).

It is also important to check the requirements for the distribution of cables to various equipment rooms, buildings or cross-connects in a site. In many cases, controlled room access or locks may be required.


.Rack Mount Splice Panel
image::media/rackMountSplicePanel.png[align="center"]

* Entrance facility or rack mounted.
* Facilitate distribution of ﬁbers and/or cables to various equipment rooms, buildings, or cross-connects.
* Must use appropriate splice holders and trays and accommodate proper bend radius.
* Transition point between outdoor and indoor cables.

== Optical Entrance Enclosures - Wall Mount 

Optical entrance enclosures provide a convenient splicing and interconnection location for outside plant cabling entering a central office, controlled environmental vault (CEV), or customer location. They are designed to allow the entrance and management of up to 60 cables for splicing and interconnecting. Cables from termination locations and the outside plant are easily installed and managed. Access to individual fiber splices and fiber bundles is made easy by splice tray and fiber management designs. Other features include:

* Provide a transition point between the OSP and internal rated cables.
* Consolidate splicing in one location.
* Save rack space.
* Multiple cable entrance ports to accommodate routing and growth.

.Optical Entrance Enclosure.
image::media/opticalEntraceClosure.png[500,500,align="center"]

=== Entrance Facilities

Depending upon the application, access to the outside plant can be provided through a variety of options and products to best meet the
designer’s requirements:

. Installation of a patch panel and routing pigtails to a splice panel.
. Installation of a distribution panel with both patching and splicing capabilities.
. Installation of a fiber management bay with both patching and splicing capabilities.
. Installation of a preterminated patch panel with a known length of cable routed to a splice panel located at the entrance facility.
. Installation of a preterminated patch panel with a known length of cable routed to a splice closure at an entrance vault.

These options require an understanding of each of the product types and usages from the entrance facility back to the transmission
equipment. The entrance facility provides a transition between outdoor loose tube cables and indoor cables when using a splice panel.

.Buiilding Entry Point (BEP).
image::media/BuildingEntryPoint.png[190,180,align="center"]

== Fiber Distribution Units - Main Cross-connects and Entrance Facilities

The ﬁber distribution unit (FDU) is a panel with splicing and patch functions combined in the same unit. Connector and splice trays may be removable for convenient access for maintenance, testing, and splicing. Available with both 19” and 23” mounting brackets. Cables are normally secured at the panel with buﬀer tubes routed to splice trays where pigtails are spliced and routed to numbered six-packs and adapters.

.Fiber Distribution Units.

image::media/fiberDistributionUnits2.png[align="center"]

== Splice Closures

Designed for splicing optical cables together from one reel to another after installation, a splice closure can allow splitting or
routing of ﬁber cables from multiple locations. The closure may permit either a butt or in-line splice application. The ﬁber optic
cable’s strength member(s) must always be secured to the splice closure, in accordance with the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations.

.TE Connecttivity.
image::media/teConnectivity.png[align="center"]

The closure must be environmentally sealed to protect the ﬁbers from water intrusion and potential freezing. After sealing the closure, perform a pressure/ﬂash test (normally at ﬁve pounds of pressure) to conﬁrm proper dome and cable entrance port sealing. Closures should also be re-enterable.

The Telcordia GR-771-CORE, titled “Generic Requirements for Fiber Optic Splice Closures”, is a comprehensive speciﬁcation with which closures must comply. The standard includes features and functions such as cable compatibility, cable entrance capacity, cable termination hardware, bonding and grounding hardware, ﬁber and splice organization including minimum bend radius, as well as ﬁber and splice protection. Performance requirements for electrical (bond clamp retention and AC fault tests), mechanical (cable clamping, sheath retention, cable ﬂexing, cable torsion, vertical drop, compression, impact, and central member retention) and environmental concerns are also included.

=== The Necessity for Excess Fiber Length

. To allow resplicing due to errors in splicing ﬁbers.
. To allow the ﬁber ends to reach the ﬁber work station or fusion splicer.
. To accommodate ﬁber movement by creeping or thermal changes.
. To allow single ﬁber splices in ring networks.

=== Splice Closure Application

* In-line splicing.
* Mid-entries.
* Restoration splicing.
* Splitter function (FTTx and HFC).
* Cross-connects.
* Optical add/drop multiplexing.
* Butt or inline styles.

== Splice Closures and Transition Tubes

Due to the versatility and importance of the splice closure, it is critical to consider its intended use, application, and environment over its lifespan. How much cable should be slacked within the closure? Normally you would want to store as much as possible to address future adds, moves, and changes.

Remember that buﬀer tubes can be pinched easily so that proper dressing (or routing) of the buﬀer tubes should be performed carefully. If buﬀer tubes and closure design do not allow proper installation of the buﬀer tube(s) to splice tray, a transition tube may be required.

Mid-entries require only one buﬀer tube to be entered. Remember to order a storage tray for holding unopened buﬀer tubes.

=== Splice Closure Transition Tubes

Splice closures use transition tubes for a variety of reasons:

. `Fiber protection` If a splice closure has hinged or movable splice trays, transition tubes should be applied over any exposed buﬀer tubes or ﬁbers to keep them from kinking or pinching during movement,as they are generally very rigid.

. `Mid-entries` Fibers may need to be distributed from one splice tray to another and will need to be protected. Transition tubing should be applied over any bare ﬁbers and secured to the splice tray like a buﬀer tube.

. `Splitters` A 1:8 splitter requires nine (or more) spaces for the splitter (FBT, module, or cassette) and the pigtail splices. A 1:16 splitter would require 17 and the splitter package. This would mean two splice trays with a transition tube to route and protect the ﬁbers.

== Splice Closure Types

=== OSP Closures

.OSP Closure (left) & FTTX closures.
image::media/ospClosure.png[align="center"]

* High ﬁber counts.
* In-line or butt style.
* Larger.
* Environmentally sealed.
* OPGW and ADSS.

=== FTTx Closures

FTTx/PON splice closures are designed for use with splitters and mid-entries. Fusion splicing the network together to maintain low losses, these small closures provide a stable environment for slack storage, splitters and the splices by housing them in a permanent encasement. A variation of FTTx closures known as multiport service terminal (MSTs) have evolved with a hardened connector interface inside the closure
assembly that allows customer subscriptions to be diverted until the customer signs up. Internally, pigtails from these connections are routed to splice trays.

Whether closures are located at drops or mid-entries, in vaults or enclosures, proper environmental sealing is critical to prevent invasive exposure to the elements.

* Small ﬁber counts.
* Butt style.
* Smaller.
* Multiple drop ports.
* Environmentally sealed.

== Splice Trays

Internally, splice panels normally have splice trays to organize and house either fusion or mechanical splices. All splice trays should be designed for proper bend radius for both single-mode and multimode ﬁbers. Other additional concerns include:

* Color code organization.
* Securing the cable and buﬀer tube elements.
* Routing and securing the ﬁber, buﬀer tube and pigtails.
* Bonding to ground if metallic elements are present.
* Deeper trays for ribbon ﬁbers.
* Housing splitters.

== Splice Tray Recommendations

.Blocking Loose Tube Gel.
image::media/looseTubePigtail.png[300,300,float="right"]

Most ﬁber networks are designed for a 25-year life span. Over time, many additions, moves, and changes will occur. Normally you would want to store spare cable buﬀer tubes and ﬁber slack in the splice tray to address these future adds, moves, and changes.

Splice Trays
Most splice trays are designed to hold up to twelve ﬁbers in a design that addresses both mechanical and optical radius concerns. This includes proper bend radius, color code organization, securing of the buﬀer tubes and proper labelling. Ribbon splices require deeper trays than standard types.

=== Loose Tube to Loose Tube

This structure is most common in closures where two tubes are spliced together. If the yellow tube is being spliced to a yellow tube, each containing twelve ﬁbers, the following must be considered:

. Securing the tubes.
. Blocking the tubes.
. Routing the ﬁbers.
. Splicing the ﬁbers.
. Protecting the splice.
. Mounting the splices into holders. 

=== Loose Tube to Pigtails

. Securing the tube.
. Blocking the tube.
. Routing the ﬁbers.
. Labeling the pigtails.
. Securing the pigtails.
. Splicing the ﬁbers.
. Protecting the splice.
. Mounting the splice into holders.

[NOTE]
Remember that pigtails use 900-µm coatings and 3-mm jackets and will reduce the amount of space in the tray. +
Remember that once you use all of the ﬁber slack, you must cut back the cable to recover morebuﬀer tube for the splice tray. +
Ribbon ﬁbers require speciﬁc splice protectors and splice trays. They also require care in routing and slack storage. Ribbon mid-entries can be diﬃcult and must be taken into consideration when selecting splice trays, closures, and patch panels.

== Fanout and Breakout Kits

When terminating loose tube cable into rack- or wall-mounted patch panels, it is recommended that afan out or breakout kit be installed onto the ﬁbers for additional physical protection.

Fanout kits are installed onto loose tube cables to build up a 250-µm ﬁber to the minimum size of 900 µm that is recommended for direct termination with plugs. Fan out kits should be used inside a panel, rack, or cabinet so that the cabinet supports the weight of the cable and no stress is placed on the ﬁbers or connectors.

Breakout kits build up loose tube cables to 3-mm breakout-style cordage so that they have more durability and structural integrity. This is beneﬁcial if they are to be installed in high-traﬃc areas and plugged directly into equipment.

In most cases, when terminating unitube cables, the ﬁbers will need to be separated into smaller, more manageable groups in order to splice or terminate with plugs. This can be accomplished by using a pitchfork splitter and buﬀer tubing. After the ﬁbers have been divided into smaller groups, they will resemble a stranded cable, at which point either of the two previous methods can take place.

== Buildings and Campuses

The term “campus” can include hospitals, airport terminals, business parks, schools, oﬃce buildings, government facilities, military bases, and factories. These can be vertical and/or horizontal structures located over large areas.

The age, structure, user density, and bandwidth requirements of the building or campus will directly inﬂuence the method of cable installation and where ﬁber and cable management products are placed. What type of ﬁber is required to support current and future bandwidth requirements of the users? What termination technique should be used? Should bend-insensitive ﬁbers be used? Most campuses use data
communications, but video services and security systems can also be a part of the requirements.

Building entrance sites and indoor and OSP transition sites need to be located, including telecom, communication, or utility closets. Where should cable and ﬁber management products be located within these sites and elsewhere throughout each building?

== Campus or Building Star Topology

The backbone hierarchical star topology is used for campus, building, or FTTx designs. The following example shows how the cabling can be organized using a star topology and in accordance with the TIA-568 Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling and the IEC 11801 Generic Cabling for Customer Premises standards. The span distances should be calculated for attenuation based on the distance, the number of
terminations, the ﬁber type, and the wavelength. The ﬁber type, distance, and wavelength are also used to determine the bandwidth for multimode ﬁbers, or the dispersion for single-mode ﬁbers.

== Typical Building Layout

In this example, an outdoor-style loose tube cable enters the building. To meet NEC requirements, the cable must not extend for more than 50 feet (15 meters) into the building. The entrance facility (EF) may be designated as a telecommunications room (TR), telecommunications closet (TC), equipment room (ER), common equipment room (CER), or a common telecommunications room (CTR). Regardless of its designation, this is where access providers and service providers may provide equipment access and terminations.

The main cross-connect (MC) is used to cross connect the backbone cables from the entrance facility. Normally wall-mounted patch panels are used at horizontal cross connects (HCs) for connections and/or splices to the horizontal cables linking work areas (WA) and or subscriber locations in ﬁber to the building multidwelling units (MDU) and multitenant unit (MTU) installations.

Be sure to specify the proper listings for all indoor cables being used. OFNP or OFNR plenum- or riser-rated cables must be used inside the buildings.

.Typical Building Layout.
image::media/typicalBuildingLayout.png[400,400, align="center"]

TIA-568 allows 300 meters (984 feet) between the centralized cross-connect (MC or IC) and the work area (WA).

NEC Articles 250 and 800 require that all communications systems entering a building be bonded to the building’s grounding electrode system. “Systems” includes the equipment. In the case of ﬁber optics cables, only those with metallic members need to be bonded to ground.

== Premises Panels - Horizontal Cross-connects

Designed for applications of up to 144 ﬁbers, the premises panel is designed for wall mounting and allows the user ﬂexibility in cable routing, connector types, and splice methods. The unit usually has one or two latched doors with locking mechanisms, allowing the splices to be locked and all patching work done in an unlocked portion. The primary applications are intermediate (IC) and horizontal (HC) cross-connects
in local area networks (LANs), but they are often used by service providers at building entrances (FTTB) with an optional splice tray for holding single-mode pigtail splices.

== Fiber Raceway Systems

Fiber management systems were developed to protect the optical cables inside physical facilities where routing and protection are required. This includes areas such the central office, head-ends, customer premises, computer rooms, and data centers. They provide clearly identified cable routes while protecting the cables from bend radius and uncontrolled transition problems. They also keep cables organized while
requiring less space.

.Fiber Raceway Systems.
image::media/environmental.png[250,250,align="center"]

Cables can include preterminated high fiber count cables meeting plenum and riser rated NEC requirements and intra-facility patchcords used to interconnect terminal equipment, optical cross connects, and building entrance cabinets. Manufacturers normally will provide a family of related products that can be integrated easily to handle vertical and horizontal needs of cable routing. Related products required for
a complete family of fiber management systems including straight sections, fittings, junctions, support kits, downspouts, elbows, Ts, end caps, and crosses. The goal of each component is not only to protect the cables, but to ease installation and address physical flexibility for adds, moves, and changes.

=== Mechanical

Fiber management products must be designed to maintain the optical fiber and cable’s installed minimum bend radius specifications. They are most often found in 2”, 4”, and 6” variations with widths up to 24”. They are designed to be mounted above racks, cabinets, and frames, as well as under raised floors where they provide better airflow for plenum areas.

=== Environmental

UL 94V and UL 2024 and NEC 770.51 rated and designed for Telcordia Network Equipment Building System (NEBS) general recommendations:

* Protects optical cable inside facilities.
* Provides clearly identified cable routing between panels and transmission equipment.
* Organizes cables while saving space.
* Easy installation of preterminated patch panels.
* Mechanical features.
* Environmental recommendations.

== Work Area (WA) Media Outlets

.Minimum 25 mm (1.0”) bend radius outlet & Telecommunication media outlet.
image::media/mediaOutlets1.png[align="center"]

With ﬁber-to-the-desk (FTTD) and ﬁber-to-the-building (FTTB) applications, protection, routing aesthetics, and optional interfaces are becoming more important. Two ﬁbers are recommended along with one meter of slack at the equipment outlet.

Since most workstations generally use a mix of applications and media types, +
it is important to maintain ﬂexibility in the media outlet products. For locations with multiple users, +
such as oﬃces where partitions or modular furniture is used, the multi-user telecommunications +
outlet assembly (MUTOA) can be used. They are also known as telecommunications outlets (TOs) or equipment outlets (EOs).

== OSP Fiber and Cable Management

Outside plant cable management products must secure, route, and protect the optical cables as well as their internal buﬀer tubes and ﬁbers. One key requirement for these products is cable and ﬁber management. They must control proper bend radius, be ﬂexible, and support cable and ﬁber identiﬁcation using color codes or numbering sequences. Other important factors include strain relief, grounding and bonding if metallic
members are present, and environmental sealing with future access.

These products are designed speciﬁcally for the mechanical task they will perform.

In all ﬁber optic applications, the cable is placed between two sites. Therefore, some type of cable management product must be used at each end of the span, usually an indoor type of cabinet or panel. There  are often splice points or mid-entries along the span, which are often enclosed in splice closures. However, other applications such as ﬁber to the home have high-ﬁber-count trunk cables for access to drop cables
that provide service for subscribers. New types of ﬁber distribution hubs, pedestals, and closures have been speciﬁcally designed to provide ﬁber, cable, and circuit management while housing splices, connectors, optical splitters, and future wavelength division multiplexers.

== Outside Plant Cable Management Overview

The ﬁber distribution hub (FDH) addresses ﬁber optic cable, ﬁber, splitter, and circuit management for FTTx applications, as well as splicing, patching, and splitting. What makes the FDH unique is that it addresses ﬁber circuit management in the OSP.

The FDH can be mounted on the ground, on a pole, or in a building. It is environmentally sealed from dust, rain, wind, and rodents. The cabinets are designed to be breathable and are strictly passive cabinets.

== Fiber Distribution Hubs

The fiber distribution hub (FDH) is an outside plant cabinet designed to house fiber optic splitters with splicing and patch functions combined in the same unit. Designed for FTTx installations, the FDH allows for effective cable and fiber management, and for maximizing take rate when grouping splitters into local serving areas. The FDH is mostly used in centralized architectures, but can be used in distributed designs as well. FDHs come in many sizes and configurations with variations for pedestal, pole, or wall-mount mounting.

The FDH should be placed so that the cable is terminated or an mid-entry is performed for the buffer tube or fiber access. Fibers are then spliced to splitters and pigtails routed to an internal cross-connect (patch) panel. Drop cables to streets or homes would be internally pigtailed, spliced, and routed to corresponding ports in the patch panel for reconnection to the OLT path.

Modular connector and splitter housings can provide flexibility. The types of splitters installed can range from a small concatenation of many to the recommended maximum. The input fiber is pigtailed to an appropriate connector for loss and reflection. Each incoming fiber is terminated and routed to the input port of the splitter.

Pigtails are attached to the fiber in the customer’s drop cable that is fed in and stored in the bottom of the cabinet. Once a customer has signed-up for service, a pigtail is taken from its parked position on the patch panel, routed, and then plugged into the output of the splitter module. The parked position provides cable/connector storage and termination to reduce reflection during the time the connector is not in use.

== Fiber Access Terminals - Pedestals

Pedestals provide ﬁber routing, storage, patching, splicing, and splitting capabilities. Cable storage and routing are in the base. Once the ﬁber from the cable is exposed, then it can be utilized to either a splice closure or cabinet. FTTH pedestals, which are also known as ﬁber access terminals (FATs), tend to be smaller than ﬁber distribution hubs (FDHs) and are an option for servicing local neighborhoods and serving areas.

When considering what type of containment will protect each component of the PON system, thought must be given to whether the assembly contains splitters, curbside electronics, battery backup, security,  air conditioning, and/or alarms associated with various installation and electrical codes. These factors will determine the size and style of the enclosure assembly.

The general location of the enclosure should be out of the direct traﬃc pattern to help prevent accidental vehicular damage and to provide access for technicians.

== Multiport Service Terminals

Historically as fiber gets closer to the end user, fiber count drops and construction and labor costs increase. For this reason, termination techniques have evolved to lower installation costs while still maintaining quality terminations. The multiport service terminal (MST), used for low-cost installations, is an example of this. Preterminated hardened drop cables reduce labor costs to installing the MST, accessing the fiber(s) from the distribution, and the dressing, cleaning, and connecting the drop cable. Available with port counts of 4, 6, 8, or 12, this technique can service multiple residences easily.

MSTs with splitters provide even greater options for designers. They are available for aerial and below-
grade installations, and are adaptable for applications where fiber optic cables must be located in the future.

* Dress slack during installation.
* Keep ports capped when not in use.
* Clean ferrules and adapters every time the port is exposed.

== Fiber Transition Terminals

.Fiber Transmissionn Terminal.
image::media/fiberTransmissionTerminal.png[300,300, align="center"]

Fiber transition terminals (FTTs) offer a connector interface that gives a subscriber access to services.  This unit is placed on the side of the customer’s premises, usually where the optical network terminal (ONT) will be installed in the future. When the customer accepts services, a technician opens the FTT and patches the connectors so that the system will begin to supply services to the customer.

In FTTx installations, the FTT acts as a transition point during the construction phase. Drop cables can be installed and slack left until the user subscribes to services that would require an ONT. Once this occurs the FTT can serve as the splice point for the pigtail, saving valuable space in the ONT.

In FTTB applications, the FTT also acts as a small cross-connect terminal as there may be higher fiber counts, splicing needs and connector ports for cross connections. Normally these would be secured and placed at an entrance facility or telecommunications closet.

== Cabling Scenarios - Fiber to the Home

.Conventional Drops.
image::media/ftthConventionalDrops.png[align="center"]

Designers and installers of FTTx drop cables have several options for the ﬁnal terminations. The conventional technique is to install the drop cables and splice the cable into a splice closure or pedestal. A pigtail would be spliced to the drop cable at each optical network terminal (ONT) located at the home or building. Installers may choose to have long pigtails with preterminated connectors on one end. This
pigtail would then be back pulled to the splice closure or pedestal where the cable slack would be trimmed  as required. All the splicing and preparation work would be at one location using existing trailers, splicing vehicles and equipment. New low-cost fusion splicers, mechanical splices and ﬁeld-installable single-mode connectors are options for installers for the termination at the ONT.

.Predetermined Drops.
image::media/ftthPredeterminedDrops.png[align="center"]

Preterminated drop cables use hardened connectors as speciﬁed by Telcordia GR-3120. These hardened ﬁber-optic connectors (HFOC) allow for low-cost installations. Th ese drops are manufactured in standard lengths. Single-ended drops can help to minimize slack challenges at the pedestal or closure where many of these cables are routed from and to consolidate the splicing at a convenient and accessible location. The
connectors are typically a SC/APC or UPC type and have modiﬁ ed outer coupling mechanism and dust caps. These cables and connectors are also rigid with limited bend radius with most using central tube drop cable designs.

== Cabling Scenarios - Intelligent Transportation Systems

.Transport System One.

This technique involved having a splice closure in a localized handhole and a multiﬁber preterminated Trafficrouted management pigtail and splicedcenter into the closure. The other end is routed into the cabinet to a wall mount panel (preferred) or to the speciﬁc devices to be connected (less ﬂexibility for future adds,Handhole drops and changes). This Underground requires a larger wall mount distribution (splice/patch) panel. PoliMod connector panels with preterminated Splice ﬁber optic Splice vault  closure cable stubs lowers installed cost.

.Transport System Two.

== Vaults and Handholes

Vaults can either be above ground or below ground. They can be powered and conditioned for electronics, or have nothing in them except for mounting splice closures and storing cable slack. Vaults can be as complicated with their organization so as to accommodate multiple types of cable entry or egress, or they can provide minimal slack storage depending on the need. Controlled environmental vaults (CEV) can also
house electronic equipment.

Vaults can be large and made from either concrete for maximum protection or plastic for underground  burial with minimal exposure. Vaults represent security for the ﬁber optic installation and have become one the essential housings for FTTx systems.

Handholes are always located underground and require space to hold slack cable and splice closures.

Always make sure that the cable is within the its bend radius speciﬁcations to prevent damage and macrobend losses during storage.

Splitter locations need to accommodate splice closures, drop cable, slack storage from all locations and distribution cable slack.
