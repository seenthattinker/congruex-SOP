== Not to Exceed Chart for Multimode Spans

_Not to exceed_ spreadsheets are great for installers, contractors and inspectors. They identify the total loss values of the optical cable, connectors, and splices, and help to easily pinpoint fiber spans that are out of specification. Contractors and installers normally provide optical loss testing using the stabilized light sources and calibrated optical power meter to measure the attenuation levels between the transmission equipment’s patch panels to demonstrate proof of performance. These tests normally are performed bidirectionally and
at 850 nm and 1300 nm, based on TIA-568 specifications for 62.5/125 graded-index multimode fibers for a given span length.

There is also a column for the additional connection loss (see Note 1), based on performing fiber optic testing when using the insertion loss technique as specified in TIA-455-171-A, test method B (attenuation by substitution measurement), and TIA-526-14B, method A (optical power loss measurements of installed multimode fiber plant). The final measurement in this column is a _not to exceed_ number in dB.

== Not to Exceed Chart for Single-mode Spans

_Not to exceed_ spreadsheets are great for installers, contractors, and inspectors. They identify the total loss values of the optical cable, fiber, connectors, splices, and splitters, and help to easily pinpoint fiber spans that are out of specification. Contractors and installers normally provide optical loss testing using the stabilized light sources and calibrated optical power meter to measure the attenuation levels between the transmission equipment’s patch panels to demonstrate proof of performance. These tests normally
are performed bidirectionally and at 1310 nm and 1550 nm. In single-mode systems these tests also are performed using the OTDR.

Based on generic specifications for G.652 single-mode fibers for a given span length for 1310-nm and 1550-nm wavelength-based systems.

In addition, a column has been added for the additional connection loss (1) based on performing fiber optic testing when using the insertion loss technique as specified in TIA-455-171-A, test method B (attenuation by substitution measurement) in this column is a _not to exceed_ number in dB.

== Measurement and Result Considerations

== Gainers on OTDR Traces

.Gainer.
image::media/ODTRspliceloss.png[align="center"]

The OTDR trace shows a splice loss followed by an apparent gain at a splice point. A splice gain is a measurement artifact common on OTDR traces. There is no actual gain. When reporting splice loss, the OTDR makes the assumption that all fiber segments have the same backscatter capture coefficient, _K_, which can be a default or user entered. Typical values are -79 to -81 dB for standard G.652 fiber.

Different fiber types —  even similar types from the same manufacturer —  may have small variations in K (ratio of backscatter captured). This can affect the apparent splice loss reported on the trace. If the downstream fiber has a higher K, and the difference is greater the actual splice loss, then the OTDR may report a gainer. These are usually very small, and may be small enough to be accepted in a one-way OTDR test.

If the actual splice loss must be known to greater accuracy, then testing bidirectionally and averaging reported splice losses will yield more accurate values. This is because the backscatter change reverses sign in the opposite direction while the splice loss is actually the same in both directions.

== Fiber Roll-off

The trace of a fiber that gradually rolls off is the signature of a nonreflective broken fiber. The signature is common in cables where water or cable gel has created a nonreflective surface after a break. Since this break is usually poor, the optical signal is dispersed and does not have the power to return to the source.

Fiber measurements should be made with the distance marker located at the point where the roll-off occurs. From this location, the distance equal to the operating pulse width must be subtracted to accurately locate the failure. The pulse width may vary with instruments, so it is best to check your operating manual
for confirmation.

== Fiber Roll-off

Fiber roll-off in telecom refers to the phenomenon where the transmission loss of an optical fiber increases at wavelengths outside of the fiber's normal operating range. This can be caused by several factors, including:

. Dispersion: Dispersion is the phenomenon where the speed of light changes as it travels through an optical fiber. This can cause the different wavelengths of light in the fiber to travel at different speeds, leading to fiber roll-off.

. Absorption: Absorption is the process by which light is absorbed by the material of the optical fiber. Absorption is typically higher at longer wavelengths, which can cause fiber roll-off.

. Scattering: Scattering is the process by which light is scattered by impurities or imperfections in the material of the optical fiber. This can cause the light to be absorbed or reflected, leading to fiber roll-off.

. Polarization mode dispersion: Polarization mode dispersion is a phenomenon where the different polarizations of light travel at different speeds through the optical fiber, leading to fiber roll-off.

Understanding and mitigating fiber roll-off is important in telecom, as it can affect the performance and reliability of optical fiber transmission systems.

* Breaks (fractured fiber).
* Extreme macrobend.
* Fractured fiber with gel surrounding the end.
* Fractured fiber with moisture (water) surrounding the end.

When testing a suspected break with the OTDR, it is important to confirm that the fiber is actually broken. Extreme macrobends can look like a roll-off signature, yet the cable’s internal fibers are still intact. To verify, put the OTDR into real-time mode and check all the dark fibers in the span. Once a fiber is identified with a Fresnel (reflective) signature, then we have a confirmation of a fiber break.

The second advantage of this technique is that once a Fresnel reflection is located, it is easier to accurately place the OTDR’s distance cursor at the actual location of the break. Whenever possible, the OTDR operator should use the last splice location (closest to the fault) in the span to measure the distance to the fault. This will be more accurate than if done from the longer distance to the test equipment location, due to the differences in the fiber length versus the cable length in cable structures.


=== Testing Through Optical Splitters

Point-to-point insertion loss testing through fully-installed, long-haul networks measures the three basic components of a fiber optic system: connectors, splices, and the optical fiber. With the inclusion of optical splitters, the fiber plant expands from a single point-to-point system to a point-to-multipoint network. This not only includes attenuations from the components above, but also the higher loss of the splitter(s). One example would be if a network installation had a 1:4 splitter installed, approximately 6-7 dB of attenuation
would be measured along with the components of the OSP for each of the four legs completed. A 1:32 splitter would incur 15.8 dB of attenuation.

== Key Points to Understanding IOR

* Index of refraction (IOR) is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum as compared to the fiber and is used to calibrate the OTDR to the fiber under test.
* OTDRs measure fiber length, not cable length. The technician must compensate for additional fiber length by using the sequential cable markings to acquire correct cable length.
* To accurately calibrate the OTDR, the technician must know the fiber size and type, the wavelength, and the manufacturer of the fiber.

=== Index of Refraction

Index of refraction is the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to the velocity of light in a refractive material for a given wavelength.

If light travels 186,291 miles per second in space (vacuum) and 126,642 in a single-mode fiber (at 1310 nm), then the ratio would be 1.471. The fact that the light travels at different speeds is important to understand. In fiber, the speed varies depending upon the construction of the type of glass and the wavelength of the light being transmitted. For multimode fiber, group mode velocity defines the average mode due to the multiple modes being transmitted.

=== Does My OTDR Accurately Measure the Length of the Cable Being Tested?

Probably not. The IOR numbers given to end users come from the fiber manufacturers, and not the cable manufacturers. There is a great amount of difference when measuring a single fiber on a fiber spool versus inside an optical cable.

There are three major reasons why fiber lengths don’t match cable lengths:

. `Fiber lay inside a loose tube buffer`. You will notice that the fiber length is actually longer than the buffer tube itself. This allows the cable and buffer tube to expand and contract without stressing the internal fiber.

. `Buffer tubes wrapping around internal cables`. Buffer tubes do not lay lengthwise down an optical cable but spiral instead. First they will all spiral in one direction (clockwise) and periodically will reverse (counterclockwise). This extra length of buffer tube versus the cable jacket (sheath) length adds an additional variation in the fiber versus cable length.

. `Inner and outer rows of buffer tubes`. When fiber counts within the cable exceed 72 fibers (six tubes with 12 fibers each), there is a high chance that the cable design is one provided in multiple rows of buffer tubes in both inner and outer positions. The inner row has less wrapping and total length, whereas the outer row must have larger wraps. Therefore, the internal fiber must be longer than those in the internal row. This requires extreme detailing on records. The inner layer fibers will be shorter and therefore use a different IOR. These must be traced to the correct patch panel connectors.

=== How Do I Resolve This?

This is resolved with the proper acceptance testing of a reel of cable. By testing the cable with an OTDR, you are in a position to change the factory IOR settings to those that will match the cable jacket’s sequential markings.

For example, if the documentation specifies 1.471 at 1310 nm and the shipping documentation on the reel shows the cable length to be 5,000 meters, the OTDR would measure the length at approximately 5,150 meters, assuming a 3% variation in fiber length.

Now check the sequential markings on the cable. If the difference measures to be 5,004 meters, then the IOR (which controls the timing) must be adjusted on the OTDR to compensate for the actual cable length versus the actual fiber length. In this case, we would increase the IOR until the OTDR length matches that of the cable under test. Remember the OTDR will measure from the instrument’s front panel, unless
programmed otherwise.

Also remember to check both inner and outer layers for different CIR (cable index of refraction) settings. These recordings should be noted in any maintenance and restoration plans for more accurate locates.

How else can you increase accuracy? Through better documentation titled _as-builts_ or _as-built drawings._ These will identify a sequential marking on a cable to a fixed geographic point. If a cable has been damaged 2,000 meters from the fourth splice point in a span, it is far easier to measure (using a two-point technique) from the last (known) splice point to the fault than from the patch panel to the fault.

Accuracy also includes factors such as distance so the closer to a known point the better. Another way to address this is to question which is more accurate: 1% at 2,000 meters, or 1% from 19,000 meters?
