= End to End link Loss

An end-to-end link loss test is a way to measure the amount of signal loss that occurs between two points in a communication system. This test is typically used to diagnose problems with the link, such as interference or faulty equipment. To perform an end-to-end link loss test, you will need to have access to the two points at which the link is connected, as well as a device for measuring the signal strength. 



== Purpose 

An end-to-end link loss test is used to determine the amount of signal loss that occurs between two points in a communication system. This can be useful for identifying problems with the link or for determining the maximum distance that a signal can travel without becoming too weak to be useful. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the communication system is operating correctly and efficiently.


== Requirements

To perform an end-to-end link loss test, you will need the following:

. Two points of communication that are connected by a link. This could be two computers connected by a network cable, or a transmitter and receiver connected by an antenna.

. A device for generating a test signal. This could be a test tool that is specifically designed for this purpose, or it could be a device that is able to transmit a known signal.

. A device for measuring the strength of the signal. This could be a specialized instrument, or it could be a device that is able to measure the strength of a signal using a built-in meter or other feature.

. A way to determine the distance between the two points of communication. This could be measured using a tape measure, or it could be determined using GPS coordinates or other means.

. A way to record the results of the test. This could be done using a pen and paper, or it could be done using a computer or other digital device.

=== Devices

There are many different devices that can be used for an end-to-end link loss test, depending on the specific requirements of the test. Here are a few examples of devices that might be used:

. Network analyzer: This is a specialized instrument that can be used to generate and measure a test signal on a network. It is commonly used in the testing and evaluation of communication systems.

. Signal generator: This is a device that is able to generate a known test signal. It can be used to transmit a signal over a link and measure the strength of the received signal.

. Spectrum analyzer: This is a device that is able to measure the strength of a signal across a range of frequencies. It can be used to determine the amount of signal loss that occurs over a given frequency range.

. Power meter: This is a device that is able to measure the strength of an electrical signal. It can be used to measure the power of a signal transmitted over a link and determine the amount of signal loss that has occurred.

. Multimeter: This is a device that is able to measure a variety of electrical quantities, including voltage, current, and resistance. It can be used to measure the strength of a signal transmitted over a link and determine the amount of signal loss that has occurred.


== Procedure

Here are the general steps for performing an end-to-end link loss test:

. Connect the device for measuring the signal strength to one end of the link.
. Set the device to transmit a test signal at a known power level.
. Measure the signal strength at the other end of the link using the same device.
. Calculate the link loss by subtracting the signal strength at the receiving end from the power level at the transmitting end.

[IMPORTANT]
It's important to note that the link loss will depend on the distance between the two points, as well as any obstacles or interference that may be present. To get an accurate measurement, it's important to carefully control for these variables.
