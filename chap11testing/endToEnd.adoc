= End to End link Loss

An end-to-end link loss test is a way to measure the amount of signal loss that occurs between two points in a communication system. This test is typically used to diagnose problems with the link, such as interference or faulty equipment. To perform an end-to-end link loss test, you will need to have access to the two points at which the link is connected, as well as a device for measuring the signal strength. 



== Procedure

Here are the general steps for performing an end-to-end link loss test:

. Connect the device for measuring the signal strength to one end of the link.
. Set the device to transmit a test signal at a known power level.
. Measure the signal strength at the other end of the link using the same device.
. Calculate the link loss by subtracting the signal strength at the receiving end from the power level at the transmitting end.

[IMPORTANT]
It's important to note that the link loss will depend on the distance between the two points, as well as any obstacles or interference that may be present. To get an accurate measurement, it's important to carefully control for these variables.
